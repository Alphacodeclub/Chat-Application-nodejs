# client-server-nodejs
Chat application using Node.js &amp; SocketIO

##The web framework
The first goal is to setup a simple HTML webpage that serves out a form and a list of messages. We’re going to use the Node.JS web framework express to this end. Make sure [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.

The second goal is to setup/install dependencies of socketIO --> npm install --save socket.io


#RUN node index.js 


and browse https://localhost:3000

that's it
